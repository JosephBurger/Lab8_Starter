## 1 - Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed because it allows the devloper to automate the process, as well as providing the developer with the ability to test while developing.

## 2 - No

## 3 - I would use end-to-end testing here because the messaging feature likely involves multiple componenets and thus unit testing might not be very efficient.

## 4 - Unit testing because checking the length of a message can be done with a very simple length check test function.
